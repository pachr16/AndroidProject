Firebase Authentication experiences problems when trying to register a new user using some emulators.

It works correctly when testing on a real android phone, but if that is not an available option, the following user can be used to login and test the system:

email: exam@sdu.dk    
password: password

For similar reasons, loading shopping lists requires going back to welcome screen and then clicking "View All Shopping Lists" again.

Have a nice day :)
